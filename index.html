		<h2>About Me!</h2>
		<p>This website was made by a nerdy person who was just bored. I'm just an ordinary gamer. Loves cats, and older stuff. I love to repurpose old tech and try to make it usable today.</p>
		<p>I don't currently have a job, still a high school student. I do know that I want to do when I can get a job; Cybersecurity or be a Software Engineer when I'm able to get a job. My dream school is MIT or ASU, and I have intentions to get lots and lots of certifications.</p>
		<p>I have basic knowledge of how computers work, I can code in HTML and CSS, I have an ok grasp of how Linux works, I can build a PC, I know basic computer networking, and I am a fast learner</p>
